##Wolf is a starter theme for WordPress.
*You can take Wolf and hack away on it. No need for a parent theme.*

###Why Wolf is awesome:

Based on [underscores](https://github.com/automattic/_s), Wolf comes with:

 * A just right amount of lean, well-commented, modern, HTML5 templates.
 * A helpful 404 template.
 * A sample custom header implementation in inc/custom-header.php that can be activated by uncommenting one line in functions.php and adding the code snippet found the comments of inc/custom
 * header.php to your header.php template.
 * Custom template tags in inc/template-tags that keep your templates clean and neat and prevent code duplication.
 * Some small tweaks in /inc/tweaks.php that can improve your theming experience. They can be activated by uncommenting one line in functions.php.
 * Keyboard navigation for image attachment templates. The script can be found in js/keyboard-navigation.js. Itâ€™s enqueued in functions.php.
 * 5 sample CSS layouts in /layouts: Two sidebars on the left, two sidebars on the right, a sidebar on either side of your content, and two-column layouts with sidebars on either side.
 * Smartly organized starter CSS in style.css that will help you to quickly get your design off the ground.
 * The GPL license in license.txt. :) Use it to make something cool


Added:

* Complete implenmentation of the [Theme Hook Alliance](https://github.com/zamoose/themehookalliance) hooks.
* Modular SASS based styles
* Grid system based on [Zurb Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com)
* HTML5 Boilerplate htaccess rules
